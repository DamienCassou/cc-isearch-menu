* cc-isearch-menu - A Transient menu for isearch

This package contains a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] menu for isearch. When in basic isearch mode, this menu can be raised by pressing the ~<f2>~ key. A menu of different isearch commands will be offered as shown below:

#+begin_src elisp :lexical yes

#+end_src

The keybinding to ~cc-isearch-menu-transient~ can be changed to user preference.

The following isearch commands are grouped as follows in the Transient menu ~cc-isearch-menu-transient~. Keys associated with each command are shown enclosed in parentheses.

* Support for Repeat Commands and Editing
Most all of the commands above will dismiss the menu when selected. There are however some exceptions to support repeated usage. When selected these commands will /not/ dismiss the menu. To dismiss the menu use the ~d~ key. These commands are:

- ~isearch-yank-word-or-char~ (~w~)
- ~isearch-repeat-forward~ (~n~)
- ~isearch-repeat-backward~ (~p~)

Another command that will not immediately dismiss the menu is ~isearch-edit-string~ (~e~). This allows for fine-grained editing of the search string while also keeping the choices provided by the menu.
